## Choose

1. take a react-boilerplate as a reference as it has almost all that we needed to start a new project i.e bundling(webpack), codeQuality (Eslint), code beautifier (prettier), unittesting (testing-lib/react) etc. etc.
2. react-boilerplate has very good community so if you suck somewhere they will help us.
3. redux, i love to use it as it is easy to maintain states.
4. it has style component feature that will make each tag as component and you will get better result.

## Quick start

1.  Make sure that you have Node.js v8.15.1 and npm v5 or above installed.
2.  Clone this repo `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/aenkgujarati/react-autocomplete.git <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>`
3.  Move to the appropriate directory: `cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>`.<br />
4.  Run `npm install`
5.  you can run `npm start` to see the example app at `http://localhost:3000`.\_

Now you're ready to rumble!
